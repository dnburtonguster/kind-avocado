  Obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder. It causes
  breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep.

In May 2005, the National Sleep Foundation released a comprehensive review of the science on sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is defined as a serious sleep disorder, with significant or long-term effects on several biological systems. Sleep apnea causes patients to be fatigued during the day, have problems with memory and thinking, or develop complications due to hypertension. 

While cause and effect in sleep apnea are difficult to pin down, one possibility is that the tongue, opening towards the upper part of the throat, relaxes, closing up the diaphragm, and disconnecting the airway. This predisposes to intermittent breathing. Sleep apnea can affect anyone, but more women have more of it than men. Adults between 20 and 49 have the most problems with sleep apnea. Older adults are most at risk of sleep apnea causing side effects and impairment. Obstructive sleep apnea can impact your health in several ways, if left untreated. Those at risk for sleep apnea should have a full evaluation with a sleep specialist.


##What causes obstructive sleep apnea?
	
If you are experiencing snoring and breathing problems, take your sleep apnea testing results to your primary care physician to discuss whether you need a sleep disorder evaluation. You may need to be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea before getting pregnant. Your primary care physician may send you to a sleep disorder evaluation center where you can be tested for sleep apnea and other common sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Your primary care physician will evaluate your sleep apnea and evaluate you for other sleep problems that can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke and related complications. 

Obstructive sleep apnea can cause a number of adverse effects including daytime sleepiness, difficulty in focus and problem-solving in school and work, disturbed sleep and weight gain. But many people with sleep apnea don’t even know they have sleep apnea because of its early signs such as loud snoring. Most patients will begin developing symptoms at age 40 and most develop sleep apnea before age 40. But as younger patients start to notice the fatigue, the sleepiness and snoring, or they realize their breathing is interrupted by snoring, many physicians recommend an evaluation of sleep apnea.


##What is the difference between obstructive sleep apnea and sleep apnea?

The most common cause of obstructive sleep apnea in adults is obesity and excess weight. Most people with sleep apnea have a body mass index greater than 30. Other factors also may cause sleep apnea, such as war or work-related stress, high blood pressure, depression, folic acid deficiency, thyroid deficiency, stroke, diabetes, anemia and liver or kidney disease. In children, causes of obstructive sleep apnea often include enlarged tonsils or adenoids and dental conditions such as a large overbite. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may benefit from longer sleep periods.


##What is the difference between obstructive sleep apnea and sleep apnea?

According to the Centers for Disease Control, up to 1 in 5 adults has mild-to-moderate sleep apnea, and 1 in 3 adults has moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. For people with severe sleep apnea, the symptoms can remain undiagnosed because the snoring, coughing, snoring continuously, and daytime sleepiness are, at least, annoying. Dr. Lago's syndrome, in contrast, presents in stages, usually occurring during the late stages of sleep. These episodes may last no more than 5 seconds and can occur anywhere, or in the middle of the night during any waking period. In more severe cases, they may occur intermittently during a period of prolonged sleep. 

If you suffer from episodes of chest pain during sleep and are concerned, you may have difficulty falling asleep or waking up. Your doctor should investigate whether you are having a fullness of chest pain or decreased lung capacity, and if so, treat the problem promptly. Central sleep apnea may require a breathing machine, or wear of a mask, to correct the issue. For young children, tape pads may be used to ensure they don't take turns pressing their chest while sleeping. Having this equipment on you at night is recommended. 

As you get older, your doctors may recommend additional treatment steps. Tackling sleep apnea has many advantages - none of which should be confused with addressing obesity. Central sleep apnea occurs because your brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control your breathing. This condition is different from obstructive sleep apnea, in which you can't breathe normally because of upper airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea.


##What is the best treatment for obstructive sleep apnea? 

CPAP masks block out the air you breathe through your nose, and when you wake up, your airways relax back into the normal position. This is known as performing “prolonged open apnea”. Each mask has electrodes in a foam padding that are connected to a suction head that you wear while sleeping. In typical practice, patients can use 8-10 sets of masks, but this could be done with nearly any CPAP, and many patients have a more in-depth treatment program with more than 20 sets. If you have had trouble with the repeated uses of CPAP or never used CPAP, BPAP or autotitrating CPAP, then you may be able to use several different sets of masks in a more thorough treatment program to diagnose sleep apnea and develop a treatment plan.
